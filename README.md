# Visualizing My Linkedin Network

As a budding data analytics professional, reading official and unofficial documentation and producing accessible reports is par the course. As an intellectual exercise, I am creating a data visualization of my LinkedIn network using an article from Medium as my "documentation". Second to that, this exercise is also an opportunity for me to use a new and  interesting dataset that branches towards #peopledata #peopleanalytics. Thanks for visiting my repository!
