# Visualizing My Linkedin Network

As a budding data analytics professional, reading official and unofficial documentation and producing accessible reports is par the course. As an intellectual exercise, I am creating a data visualization of my LinkedIn network using an article from Medium as my "documentation". Second to that, this exercise is also an opportunity for me to use a new and  interesting dataset that branches towards #peopledata #peopleanalytics. Thanks for visiting my repository!

## Where do those in my network work?

## Additional Reporting Ideation
Using the "Connected On" column and a bit of reformatting using my pandas library, I suspect that I could identify when I gained the most connections throughout my time using Linkedin. From there, I might also be able to identify the why behind that spike in connections and use that information in growing my network in a meaningful way.
